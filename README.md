# Revenue Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the revenue generated from wine purchases ('MntWines') using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of 2240 observations (customers) with 28 variables related to marketing data, including customer profiles, products purchased, campaign success, and channel performance.

## Dataset

The dataset provides insights about various aspects related to marketing data:

- Customer profiles
- Products purchased
- Campaign success (or failure)
- Channel performance

## Tasks

### 1. Feature Selection

Out of the 27 independent variables, we will identify the variables that are important in predicting the 'MntWines' column.

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

We will apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the selected variables to reduce the number of independent variables while retaining important information.

### 3. ML Models for Prediction

We will draft the following machine learning models using the created Principal Components to predict 'MntWines':

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Trees

For each model, we will provide an inference based on its performance and predictive capabilities.

## Conclusion

This project aims to develop models that accurately predict wine purchase revenue based on various marketing data factors. By leveraging feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and different machine learning algorithms, we aim to create robust models that provide valuable insights for revenue prediction.
